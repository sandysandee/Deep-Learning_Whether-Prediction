Project Overview
This project aims to predict weather conditions using deep learning techniques. Leveraging historical weather data, the model forecasts future conditions based on trends identified within the data. The project is designed to showcase skills in data preprocessing, deep learning, and model evaluation.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for training, including handling missing values and scaling features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted data visualization and analysis to understand key patterns and relationships using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Deep Learning Model: Implemented a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras, focusing on optimizing layers and hyperparameters to achieve accurate predictions.
Performance Metrics: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to ensure reliability.
Tools and Libraries:
Python Version: 3.10.9
Deep Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras
Data Analysis Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Additional Setup: CMake at C:\Program Files\CMake\.
Project Structure
